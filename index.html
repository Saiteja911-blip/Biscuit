                Long before bakeries filled our streets with sweet aromas, the humble cookie was born by accident. 
                In 7th century Persia, where sugar was first cultivated, bakers began experimenting with small test portions 
                of cake batter to check oven temperatures. These small bites evolved into the first cookies we know today.

                Cookies spread across Europe with trade routes. Each region added its own twist — from buttery Scottish shortbreads 
                to crisp Italian biscotti. In the 1930s, Ruth Wakefield invented the chocolate chip cookie by accident, 
                forever changing dessert culture.
